# N-Tier Architecture

**Description**: Extends the concept of multi-tier architecture by adding more specialized layers. Each layer handles a specific responsibility and communicates with the adjacent layers.

**Use Case**: Large-scale applications with complex requirements, where additional layers like caching, messaging, or service layers are necessary.

**Example**: Cloud-based applications where different services (authentication, logging, etc.) are managed in separate tiers.

### Pros:
- **Flexibility**: Allows for the creation of highly modular and specialized components.
- **Scalability**: Each tier can be scaled independently based on its specific requirements.
- **Resilience**: Improved fault tolerance as issues in one layer can often be isolated.

### Cons:
- **Complexity**: Significantly more complex to design, develop, and maintain.
- **Performance**: Can introduce latency and overhead due to multiple layers of communication.
- **Cost**: Higher infrastructure and maintenance costs due to the number of layers.
