# Garbage Collectors

Garbage collection (GC) is a crucial feature of Java, designed to automatically manage memory by reclaiming space taken by objects that are no longer needed. This allows developers to focus on coding rather than manual memory management, reducing memory leaks and bugs. In Java, the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) handles garbage collection, utilizing various algorithms for different use cases.

## How Garbage Collection Works

Java uses an automatic memory management system, specifically for heap memory where objects are allocated. The JVM allocates memory, and the GC monitors which objects are no longer referenced. When an object becomes unreachable, it’s considered for garbage collection, making the memory available for future use.

The garbage collection process consists of:
1. **Marking**: Identifying which objects are still reachable.
2. **Sweeping**: Releasing the memory occupied by unreferenced objects.
3. **Compacting**: Moving the remaining objects to reduce memory fragmentation.

## Types of Garbage Collectors in Java

### 1. Serial Garbage Collector (GC)
- Uses a single thread to handle all GC tasks, making it suitable for small applications.
- It freezes all application threads during the collection process, which may cause latency issues for larger applications.

### 2. Parallel Garbage Collector (GC) (also known as "Throughput Collector")
- Multiple threads are used for garbage collection, allowing better performance on multi-core systems.
- Pauses the application during collection, but is more efficient in large applications where throughput is more important than low latency.

### 3. Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) Garbage Collector
- Designed to minimize the pauses during GC by performing most of the work concurrently with the application.
- It reduces long pauses, making it ideal for applications that require low latency. However, it may lead to memory fragmentation over time.

### 4. G1 Garbage Collector (Garbage-First)
- Divides the heap into regions and collects the regions with the most garbage first.
- Balances between throughput and latency, providing predictable pause times and making it suitable for both large and low-latency applications.
- It reduces fragmentation and offers more control over GC pauses, improving overall application performance.

### 5. Z Garbage Collector (ZGC)
- A low-latency collector that handles very large heaps (multi-terabyte).
- It performs all heavy-lifting GC operations concurrently with the application threads, leading to very short pauses (usually under 10ms).
- ZGC is ideal for applications requiring consistent low latency and handling large memory.

### 6. Shenandoah Garbage Collector
- Similar to ZGC, designed for low pause times.
- Uses concurrent techniques to ensure that garbage collection does not pause the application for long periods.
- Suitable for low-latency applications where real-time performance is required.

## Tuning Garbage Collectors

Java allows you to fine-tune the GC behavior based on your application’s needs. Key parameters include:
- **Heap size**: Adjust with `-Xms` (initial heap size) and `-Xmx` (maximum heap size).
- **GC algorithm**: You can choose the collector using JVM flags (e.g., `-XX:+UseG1GC` for G1, `-XX:+UseZGC` for ZGC).
- **GC log analysis**: By enabling GC logs (`-Xlog:gc*`), you can monitor and analyze GC behavior to optimize performance.

## Conclusion

Choosing the right garbage collector and tuning it according to your application’s needs is essential for achieving optimal performance. As Java applications scale, selecting between throughput, latency, or handling large heaps becomes increasingly important. By understanding how each GC works and how it impacts performance, developers can build more efficient and scalable Java applications.
