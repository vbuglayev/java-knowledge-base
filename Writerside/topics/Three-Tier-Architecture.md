# Three-Tier Architecture

- **Description**: This is the most common model, which separates the application into three layers:
    - **Presentation Tier**: User interface (UI) or front-end.
    - **Logic Tier**: Business logic or application layer.
    - **Data Tier**: Database or data storage layer.
- **Use Case**: Enterprise applications requiring scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.
- **Example**: Web applications where the browser is the client, the server handles business logic, and a separate database is used for data storage.

### Pros:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Easier to manage, maintain, and update each layer independently.
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale each tier individually.
- **Security**: Better control over access to data and business logic.

### Cons:
- **Complexity**: More complex to develop and maintain compared to two-tier architecture.
- **Performance**: Potential latency due to the additional layer of communication between tiers.
- **Monolithic structure of logic tier**:
  - High CPU and memory consumption makes application slower and less responsive. May require vertical scaling that is expensive and limited.
  - Low development velocity.

## Conclusion
Three-tier architecture is a common model for enterprise applications, providing scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns. 
It consists of the presentation tier, logic tier, and data tier. While it offers benefits such as easier management and scalability, 
it also introduces complexity and potential performance issues. Overall, it is a suitable choice for small applications maintained by a small team of developers.
