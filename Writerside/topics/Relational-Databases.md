# Relational Databases

- **Description**: A type of database that organizes data into tables (relations) with rows and columns. Each table has a unique key, and relationships between tables are defined using foreign keys.
- **Use Case**: Systems that require structured data, ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, and complex querying.
- **Example**: Enterprise applications, banking systems, and inventory management systems.

### Pros:
- **Structured Data**: Data is highly organized, making it easy to retrieve and maintain.
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures reliable transactions with consistency and data integrity.
- **Powerful Querying**: SQL allows complex queries to retrieve and manipulate data efficiently.

### Cons:
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling can be difficult compared to NoSQL databases.
- **Performance**: As datasets grow, relational databases may experience slower performance without proper indexing and optimization.
- **Schema Rigidity**: Changes to the data model (schema) can be complex and time-consuming.

## Conclusion
Relational databases are ideal for applications that need structured data, complex queries, and transaction reliability. However, they may struggle with horizontal scaling and performance in large-scale applications.
