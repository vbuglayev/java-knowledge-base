# Migration from Monolith to Microservices

In recent years, many companies have moved from monolithic architectures to microservices, primarily for scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. While the journey from a monolith to microservices can be complex, the most effective strategies is decomposing the system based on **[business capabilities](Decomposing-Monolith-to-Microservices-by-Business-Capabilities.md)** or **[domains/subdomains](Decomposing-Monolith-to-Microservices-by-Domains-Subdomains.md)**.

## Understanding Monolith and Microservices

### Monolithic Architecture
A **monolithic architecture** is a single, large codebase where all the components and services are tightly coupled. It typically consists of a single application that manages multiple functions, from business logic to data access, UI, and more. While monoliths can be simpler to deploy in the beginning, they often lead to bottlenecks as they grow in complexity.

### Microservices Architecture
In contrast, **microservices** architecture breaks down the application into small, loosely coupled services, each handling a specific piece of functionality. These services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, offering greater flexibility and improved fault isolation.
