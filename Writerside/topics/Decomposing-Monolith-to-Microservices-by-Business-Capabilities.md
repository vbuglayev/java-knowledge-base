# Decomposing Monolith to Microservices by Business Capabilities

## What Are Business Capabilities?

**Business capabilities** refer to what the business does to achieve its objectives—such as inventory management, order processing, customer support, etc. These capabilities are high-level, stable components that represent core functions of the business, regardless of the technology stack.

The idea behind microservices based on business capabilities is to map each microservice to a specific, bounded business function, which allows the microservices to evolve alongside business needs.

## Steps for Decomposing by Business Capabilities

### 1. Understand the Domain
Before splitting a monolith, it’s essential to understand the business domain deeply. Techniques like **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** can be valuable here. DDD divides your domain into **bounded contexts**, which align with business capabilities.

#### Domain-Driven Design Concepts
- **Bounded Context**: A boundary within which a particular business capability applies.
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Ensures both business and technical teams understand the terminology used in each bounded context.
- **Entities and Aggregates**: Models of domain concepts and groupings that are tightly linked within the bounded context.

Understanding the domain through techniques like **event storming** or **context mapping** will give you clarity on how to identify and group business capabilities.

### 2. Identify Business Capabilities in the Monolith
The next step is to identify distinct business capabilities within your monolithic application. Ask questions like:
- What are the core functions of the business?
- How do different modules in the monolith correspond to those business functions?
- Which parts of the codebase map to those functions?

Examples of business capabilities could include:
- **User Management**: Handling user profiles, authentication, and authorization.
- **Order Processing**: Taking customer orders, updating inventory, and generating invoices.
- **Payment Gateway**: Handling payments, refunds, and transaction logs.

Each of these can be a candidate for a microservice.

### 3. Prioritize and Plan Decomposition
It’s rarely feasible to convert a monolith into microservices in one go. Prioritize the business capabilities based on factors like:
- **Frequency of Change**: Business areas that change frequently should be decomposed earlier.
- **Scalability Requirements**: Capabilities that experience high traffic, such as payment processing, should be separated early for better scaling.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Critical capabilities like order processing should be prioritized to ensure better fault isolation.

### 4. Define Service Boundaries
Once you’ve identified and prioritized business capabilities, the next step is to define clear **service boundaries** for each microservice. These boundaries should align with the business capability and not violate the principle of loose coupling. Ensure that each microservice handles a distinct set of responsibilities without overlapping with others.

For example, your **Order Service** should focus purely on managing orders and should not concern itself with user authentication (handled by the **User Service**) or inventory (handled by the **Inventory Service**).

#### Questions to Define Service Boundaries:
- Is this capability independently deployable?
- Does this service require its own database or data storage?
- Can this service handle its own scaling independently?

### 5. Refactor the Monolith into Microservices
After identifying business capabilities and defining service boundaries, it’s time to gradually refactor your monolithic application.

#### Strategies for Refactoring:
- **Strangler Pattern**: Incrementally replace parts of the monolith with microservices. Start by building new features as microservices while leaving the rest of the monolith intact.
- **API Gateway**: Set up an API Gateway to manage communication between microservices and the external world, enabling backward compatibility as you gradually decompose the monolith.
- **Database Segmentation**: Each microservice should ideally have its own database to ensure loose coupling. Data synchronization between services should occur through APIs or event-driven architecture.

### 6. Implement Communication Between Microservices
Microservices rely on communication to collaborate. The two main patterns are:
- **Synchronous Communication**: Typically done via REST APIs or gRPC, where services directly invoke one another.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: This involves event-driven architecture using message brokers like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or AWS SNS/SQS.

Each microservice publishes events about changes in its business capability, allowing other services to react. This leads to a more decoupled, scalable architecture.

#### Event-Driven Architecture Example:
If the **Order Service** completes a purchase, it can publish an event such as “OrderCompleted,” which can be picked up by the **Inventory Service** to update stock levels and by the **Notification Service** to send a confirmation to the user.

### 7. Handling Data Consistency and Transactions
In a monolithic application, a single transaction can update multiple entities across the system. However, with microservices, data is distributed across services, which complicates maintaining consistency.

#### Strategies for Handling Consistency:
- **Eventual Consistency**: Adopt eventual consistency instead of strong consistency, where changes propagate across the system over time.
- **Saga Pattern**: Implement long-running transactions across multiple services by coordinating a series of distributed operations. If a step fails, the Saga compensates by rolling back the preceding steps.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Split the responsibility for reading and writing data into separate models, improving scalability and performance for complex operations.

### 8. Ensure Monitoring and Observability
Microservices increase the complexity of the system’s architecture, so monitoring and observability become critical. Ensure you implement:
- **Centralized Logging**: Use tools like ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki for aggregating logs across services.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Use tools like Jaeger or Zipkin to track requests as they flow across services.
- **Health Checks**: Build in health-check mechanisms for each service, allowing dynamic load balancing and auto-recovery in the event of failure.

### 9. Test and Optimize
Once the decomposition is complete, you need to test each microservice independently and as part of the larger system. Consider implementing:
- **Contract Testing**: Ensures that services communicate correctly with each other by testing their interfaces.
- **Integration Testing**: Verifies that the system works as expected across multiple services.

#### Performance Optimization:
- Load testing to ensure each service scales effectively.
- Database tuning to optimize query performance for services with separate databases.

### 10. Adopt Continuous Deployment
Microservices support independent development and deployment. This can be leveraged by implementing **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines. Automated testing and deployment ensure that each service can be released independently, speeding up development cycles.

## Conclusion

Decomposing a monolithic application into microservices based on business capabilities ensures a clear separation of concerns, scalability, and easier alignment with business changes. By following a systematic approach—understanding the domain, identifying business capabilities, defining service boundaries, and refactoring incrementally—you can successfully migrate to a microservices architecture. Though complex, the benefits in agility, scalability, and resilience make the journey worth it.
