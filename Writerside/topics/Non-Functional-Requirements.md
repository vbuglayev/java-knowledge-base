# Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are essential in software development, focusing on *how* a system performs its functions, 
rather than *what* it does. These requirements define the quality attributes, operational constraints, and performance 
standards that the system must meet, ensuring that it is reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.

## Key Characteristics of Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Measurability**: NFRs should be quantifiable and measurable. This allows for objective evaluation of whether the 
system meets the specified criteria.

2. **System-wide**: Unlike functional requirements, which may apply to specific features, NFRs often affect the entire 
system or significant portions of it.

3. **Cross-functional**: Non-functional requirements typically impact multiple aspects of the system, influencing design, 
architecture, and user experience.

4. **Constraints**: NFRs often impose constraints on the system's design and implementation, such as limitations on resources, 
technology choices, and performance benchmarks.

## Examples of Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The system must process 10,000 transactions per second with a response time of less than 2 seconds under peak load conditions.

- **Scalability**: The system should be able to scale to support 1 million concurrent users without degradation in performance.

- **Security**: All data transmissions must be encrypted using TLS 1.3, and the system must enforce multi-factor authentication for all users.

- **Usability**: The user interface should be intuitive, allowing new users to complete their first transaction within 5 minutes without prior training.

- **Availability**: The system must have an uptime of 99.99%, with no more than 1 hour of downtime per year.

- **Maintainability**: The codebase should be modular and well-documented to allow new developers to make changes without introducing defects.

## Importance of Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements are critical for the following reasons:

- **User Satisfaction**: NFRs directly impact user experience by ensuring that the system is responsive, reliable, and easy to use.

- **System Reliability**: They help ensure that the system is robust, secure, and capable of operating under expected and unexpected conditions.

- **Cost Management**: Properly defined NFRs can prevent costly rework by addressing quality issues early in the development process.

- **Compliance and Standards**: Many industries have specific regulatory requirements that must be met, and NFRs help ensure compliance with these standards.

## Best Practices for Defining Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Be Specific and Measurable**: Define NFRs in quantifiable terms. For example, instead of saying "the system should
be fast," specify "the system should have a response time of less than 1 second for 95% of requests."

2. **Involve Stakeholders**: Engage with both technical and non-technical stakeholders to gather comprehensive NFRs. 
This ensures that the system meets all user expectations and regulatory requirements.

3. **Prioritize Requirements**: Not all NFRs are equally important. Prioritize them based on their impact on user experience and system functionality.

4. **Consider Trade-offs**: NFRs can conflict with each other (e.g., performance vs. security). Balance these trade-offs to achieve the best overall outcome for the system.

5. **Document and Review Regularly**: Keep NFRs well-documented and review them regularly throughout the development process. 
This ensures that they remain relevant and are adhered to during implementation.

## Conclusion

Non-functional requirements are crucial in ensuring that a software system not only meets its functional goals but also 
delivers a high-quality user experience. By defining clear, measurable, and prioritized NFRs, development teams can build 
systems that are reliable, efficient, secure, and scalable. Understanding and managing these requirements effectively 
is key to delivering a successful software product that meets both user needs and business objectives.
