# Event Driven Architecture

- **Description**: A design pattern where components communicate by producing and consuming events. Events represent significant actions or changes in state, which trigger responses from other parts of the system.
- **Use Case**: Systems needing real-time data processing or decoupled interactions between services.
- **Example**: Microservices architecture where one service triggers another via an event, or IoT systems reacting to sensor data.

### Pros:
- **Loose Coupling**: Components are independent, allowing easier updates and changes.
- **Scalability**: Highly scalable, as components can operate asynchronously.
- **Real-time Processing**: Enables immediate reaction to events as they happen.

### Cons:
- **Complexity**: Event flow can be hard to track, making debugging and tracing harder.
- **Latency**: Asynchronous processing might introduce delays in some cases.
- **Reliability**: Potential loss of events if not handled properly by the broker.

## Conclusion
Event-driven architecture is ideal for highly scalable and decoupled systems requiring real-time responses. However, it introduces complexity in tracing, potential latency, and requires robust infrastructure to ensure event reliability.
