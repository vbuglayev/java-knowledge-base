# Two-Tier Architecture

- **Description**: This involves a client-server model where the client (user interface) communicates directly with the server (database or application server).
- **Use Case**: Simple applications where business logic is minimal or embedded in the client-side application.
- **Example**: Desktop applications that directly access a database.

### Pros:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to develop and deploy.
- **Performance**: Direct communication between client and server can lead to faster response times in simple applications.

### Cons:
- **Scalability**: Difficult to scale as the client is tightly coupled with the server.
- **Maintainability**: Changes in business logic require updates to the client application.
- **Security**: Increased risk since the client interacts directly with the database.
